	o 2.7.1
		Making the minNonZeroPortion threshold less stringent for the convenience of users.

4th, February, 2018
    o Release 2.2.1
        o Bug Fix.

29th, October, 2017
    o Development 2.1.7
        o Enabled RcppArmadillo 64 bit and C++11, which allow Linnorm to accept huge datasets.

20th, March, 2017
    o Development 1.99.18
        o Bug fix on BE_strength when it is set to zero.
        o Allow Linnorm.Norm to use spikein.

13th, February, 2017
    o Development 1.99.16
        o Reorganized Vignettes
        o Linnorm.limma's noINF fold change calculation now adds estimated count of one instead of adding 1 XPM.

9th, February, 2017
    o Development 1.99.11 to 1.99.15
        o Fixed a bug in minNonZeroPortion.
        o Edited comments.
        o Added more unit tests.
        o Coloring oF HClust's labels should now match their cluster.
    o Release 1.2.10
        o Fixed a bug in minNonZeroPortion.

30th, January, 2017
    o Development 1.99.10
        o Bug Fixes.
        o Added Linnorm.SGenes function.
            o This function selects stable genses from scRNA-seq data for users without spike-ins or do not want to rely on spike-ins.

26th, January, 2017
    o Development 1.99.8
        o Algorithm is now optimized for speed.
        o Added unit tests.
        o Compressed all datasets with the smallest possible format.
        o Added data imputation function. In the manual, we added this function with the note "In development".
        o Changed parameters in HVar function to make it less stringent.
        o Allow PCA and HClust to utilize data imputation. Since these two tests are more prone to zero counts, we find that data imputation can help improve their performances.
            o Note that t-SNE does not need data imputaiton and is the preferred method for cell subpopulation analysis.
        o PCA is speeded up using gmodels library.
    o Release 1.2.8
        o We now formally declare Linnorm version 1 to be deprecated.
        o Release 1.2.7 and 1.2.8 are already implemented with many modifications that are intended for Linnorm 2. Still, Linnorm version 1.99.8+ will allow more functionalities. We strongly suggest using the newer version.

17th, January, 2017
    o Development 1.99.7, Release 1.2.7
        o Finally, build is successful on bioconductor.
        o minZeroPortoin argument is renamed into minNonZeroPortion (minimum non-zero portion filtering threshold), to better reflect its real function.

2nd, January, 2017
    o Development 1.99.0
        o Improved Linnorm's algorithm
            o Added data filtering step
            o Added normalization step
        o Added new functions for normalization, t-SNE clustering.
        o Almost all functions are updated.
    o Release 1.2.1
        o It now matches 1.99.0 as much as possible.

6th, October, 2016
    o Development 1.1.16:
        o Removed warnings from loading package.
        o Fixed and updated vignettes based on Bioc Staff recommendation.
        o Implemented Linnorm.HClust function.
        o Updated Linnorm.Cor function for clustering functionalities.

27th, August, 2016
    o Development 1.1.14:
        o Updated Linnorm.Cor function to allow more functionalities.
        o Updated vignettes on Linnorm.Cor.
        o Updated reference manual.
    o Release: Fixed building error in 1.0.5, thus becoming 1.0.6.

23th, August, 2016
    o Critical update for development version 1.1.13:
        o Added Linnorm.HVar, Linnorm.Cor functions for highly variable gene discovery and gene correlation network analysis.
        o Added input argument for users who wish to reuse Linnorm transformed datasets in various functions.
        o Added keepAll argument for users to control whether filtering would remove some genes from the results.
    o Author list update in release 1.0.5.

17th, August, 2016
    o Updated author list.
    o Error preventing checks now implemented in release 1.0.4.
    o Critical: Fixed a bug that might cause Linnorm to underestimate fold change.

21st, July, 2016
    o Several new updates for the last few versions:
    o PCA analysis pipeline has been added to Linnorm.
    o Error preventing checks have been implemented, as suggested by Dr. Jing Qin. Thanks.
