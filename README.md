#Linnorm

Linnorm is an R package. The main function, Linnorm(), normalizes RNA-seq expression data or large scale count dataset for parametric tests. This is an important step in differentially expressed gene analysis and gene-correlation study.


In addition, it contains several functions that simulates RNA-seq expression data based on known distributions, including Gamma, Log Normal, Negative Binomial and Poisson. These functions assumes the input dataset to be replicates of the same sample. One good source of such dataset is the seqc dataset, which is an R package in Bioconductor.


Linnorm_x.x.tar.gz contains the installation file for R. Source codes are located in the Linnorm directory.
